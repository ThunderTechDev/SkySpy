# SkySpy ☁️

SkySpy is a simple and elegant SwiftUI app that provides up-to-date weather information for your current location and any city you search for. The app automatically adjusts its interface to a light or dark theme, depending on whether it's day or night in the location being queried, offering an intuitive and pleasant user experience.

## Features

- **Up-to-Date Weather Information:** Access current weather conditions for your location or any city entered in the search.
- **Automatic Interface Theme Adaptation:** The interface switches between light and dark mode based on the time of day for the selected location.
- **Simple and Elegant Design:** A clean and minimalist user interface developed with SwiftUI, focusing on ease of use.

## Future Improvements

- Integration of widgets for direct access to weather information from the home screen.
- Option to customize the app's theme independently of the time of day.

## Important Note

Please note that if you download and attempt to run the app as-is, it will not function correctly because the personal Token to access the weather API has been modified. You will need to create your own Token at [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for the app to work properly.
